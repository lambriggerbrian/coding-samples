Title: Test SSH Connectivity with Password and Key-based Auth

Description: Determine whether a user on a SOURCE host can connect to a TARGET host running an SSH server.

Preconditions:
    1. SOURCE host has an SSH client installed (can verify with `which ssh` on the command line).
    2. TARGET host is running an SSH server (can verify with `systemctl status sshd.service` on the command line).
    3. SOURCE host has a route to TARGET host (can verify SOURCE host has route configured with `ip route get TARGET_IP`).
    4. SOURCE host has an SSH key pair, and the TARGET host has added the public key to /home/TARGET_USER/.ssh/authorized_keys.

Assumptions:
    1. TARGET host SSH server is listening on default port 22. If not, append `-p TARGET_PORT` to ssh commands below.
    2. SOURCE host does not have an SSH config file that may have options already set for TARGET host
    3. TARGET host sshd configuration does not prevent PasswordAuthentication.

Testing Steps
    Password Authentication
    1. On the command line run the following command:
        `ssh -o PasswordAuthentication=yes TARGET_USER@TARGET_IP`
    2. The user may be asked if they want to connect to the TARGET host, respond `yes`.
    3. User will be prompted to enter the password of the TARGET_USER with a prompt like:
        `TARGET_USER@TARGET_IP's password:`
        User input will not be shown for security.
    4. Press "Enter" key when password is entered.

    SSH Key Authentication
    1. On the command line as a user with proper permissions to read the shared SSH key, run the following command:
        `ssh -i /PATH/TO/KEY_FILE TARGET_USER@TARGET_IP`
    2. The user may be asked if they want to connect to the TARGET host, respond `yes`.
    3. User will NOT be prompted to enter a password.

Expected Results
    In either case, upon successful SSH connection the user will be greeted with the TARGET_USER's default shell.

Failure Cases
    1. If the password is incorrect, user will receive the response:
        `Permission denied, please try again.`
        Verify the credentials used are correct.
    2. If the key is incorrect or not added to the TARGET_USER's authorized_keys file, the server will respond:
        `TARGET_USER@TARGET_IP: Permission denied (publickey)
        Verify the key used is correct and added to the authorized_keys file of the target user.
